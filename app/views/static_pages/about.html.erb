<h1>About</h1>
<p>This project was born from a desire to fulfill two goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    As a world traveller, I wanted a simple and aesthetically appealing way
    to track my world travels. I wanted a free and ad-free online tool that I
    could trust with my data.
  </li>
  <li>
    I wanted to expand my technical skills by building a Ruby on Rails web
    application and using D3 map projections.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  My name is Lauren Nishizaki, and you can see more of what I’m up to on my
  personal website, <%= link_to "www.laurennishizaki.com", 'https://www.laurennishizaki.com' %>.

  Source code for this project can be viewed on <%= link_to "Github", 'https://github.com/lemonnish/' %>.

  This project would not exist without Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial
  and Mike Bostock’s mapping contributions to the D3 community.
